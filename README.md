# IDEA NATION: How this country is built on ideas, and how you can do it too.

## Introduction

Good morning everyone, I'm Kathy Reid and over the next five minutes we're going to explore an *alternate timeline*. A timeline in which some of the ideas we take for granted today weren't thought of. Then, I'm going to cover some techniques to help you create the future *you* want.

## Warm Beer

*Warm beer*  _cries of eeeew from the audience!_

Without James Harrison inventing commercial refrigeration in the 1850s, many of you would be drinking warm beer. It's a hideous thought isn't it!? James Harrison first built an ice making system, and improved - iterated - upon that design, patenting a compression refrigeration system in 1857.

And because of this, there are many flow-on benefits we take for granted - cold storage for food, ice cream trucks and so on.

So thank goodness for refrigeration!

## Hills Hoist

*Damp clothes* _shudder_

So, you might have nice cool beer in summer now, but what about winter? Ever have damp clothes that you just can't get dry? Yuck!

Lance Hill was an industrial designer in the 1940s, and he invented the rotary clothesline - the eponymous Hills Hoist.

Anyone have a Hills Hoist in your back yard? Right! So, imagine a future without them. Not comfortable.

## The Ute

Right, so we have cold beer in summer and dry clothes in winter, but what about getting around? And what if you're a farmer or tradesperson and need to transport produce or equipment, and still carry your family around?

Well that's exactly the problem that Lewis Bandt solved, when he designed the first Ute at Geelong's Ford plant here in the 1930s.

Can you imagine life now without cold beer, dry clothes and a way to get around with all your tools? I know I can't!

## Ideation techniques you can use at home

Each of the ideas - refrigeration, the Hills Hoist, the Ute - emerged in Geelong (!).

If you're lacking for ideas, there's many techniques to generate them.

### Reverse thinking
We've used something called *REVERSE THINKING* here to think what life would be like without some common ideas and inventions, and this is a really great technique for thinking about how you want a situation to be different from how it is now.

### Brainstorming and daydreaming
You will have heard of *BRAINSTORMING* and *DAY DREAMING*, but there are many others.

### Story boarding and mind mapping
With *STORY BOARDING* and *MIND MAPPING* you can explore new ideas and the connections between them.

Todd has linked some more information up, and with this you can create your *own* alternate reality ;-)

Thank you
